# September Creation

## The Need:
Ransomware is becoming rapidly more prolific. Many companies simply don't know what to expect and have no idea how to prepare.

## The Purpose:
This tool is intended to give those companies a better idea of what the impact may be for their business based on its size.

## The Data:
Using data compiled and analyzed from various sources including Coveware, Sophos, CISA.gov, and Varonis, we have come up with average ransomware demand ranges for each business size category.

These are categorized largely by employee count and revenue.

### Small Business:
- 1 to 100 employees
- Revenue under $10 million

### Medium Business:
- 100 to 500 employees
- Revenue under $100 million

### Large Business:
- 500+ employees
- Revenue over $100 million


## Instructions:
